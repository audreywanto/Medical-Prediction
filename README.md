# Medical-Prediction
Graded Challenge 7

In this project, I used the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/ca-independent-medical-review/data).

This project features Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifially LSTM (RNN), to predict where a patient will get classified into (Type) based on the findings (medical summary).

The libraries used for this project includes:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- wordcloud
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn

url.txt contains the link for users to try and predict the findings themselves through huggingface deployment.
